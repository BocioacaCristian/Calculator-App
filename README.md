# Basic Calculator
 
This code is a simple calculator program that allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations. The calculator interface is created using the tkinter module in Python.

The main functionality of the program is implemented through the "add_to_calculation" function, which takes a symbol (either a number or an operator) and adds it to the current calculation string. The "evaluate_calculation" function then evaluates the current calculation using the eval() function, and displays the result in the text field. If an error occurs during evaluation, the "clear_field" function is called to clear the text field and display an error message.

Overall, the code is well-structured and easy to read. The use of global variables may not be the best practice, but it works for the purpose of this program. Additionally, the interface is simple and intuitive, making it easy for users to perform calculations.

In terms of possible improvements, the error handling could be more specific to different types of errors that may occur during evaluation. Additionally, there is no support for decimal points, which could be added in future versions of the program. Overall, this is a solid implementation of a basic calculator program in Python.
